# Repo of follow ups to the FCC projects for repetition and combining techniques

## form-play

* Utilizing form elements in combination with grid and flexbox for positioning
* Focus on reps utilizing different basic aspects of form elements and their attributes
* Utilized different techniques of grid and flexbox with containers identified by dashed borders
* No submit buttons provided as focus was on creation of forms and layout. Attempted to keep name and value attributes meaningful for submission.
* Pros:
    * Improved memory of techniques to create and manipulate layout as project progressed with ability to look over prior sections and see areas for improvement (and make necessary adjustments)
    * Improved speed of finding and parsing needed information when having to look things up
    * Improved basic understanding of how form data will be bundled to be sent to the server
* Cons: 
    * Mixing flex and grid at this point leads to a lot of head scratching and looking for proper syntax
    * Minor tweaks taking a lot of time as well as trial and error to understand
    * Does not feel fluid

## product-landing-page (fcc responsive web design project 3)

* Straightforward project using general concepts addressed in lessons.
* Fixed nav bar with internal page links
* Video element and @media required
* Pros:
    * Minimal difficulty with implementation
    * Had to look up video and @media implementation for reference and able to apply without difficulty
* Cons: 
    * No big ones for this project.
    * Will need to figure out best practices for fixed nav bars on dynamically sized pages. The issue is keeping page spaced properly on larger screens when stretching can be an issue. Topic to pursue.
